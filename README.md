# Oring - Open source webring

## What is a webring?

  A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.

  To be a part of the webring, each site has a common navigation bar. It contains links to the previous and next site in the web ring. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at. This is the origin of the term webring.

 The select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline.

The advantage of a webring is that if a visitor is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another similar website. This shared traffic is beneficial to smaller Member Sites.

Member sites add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary HTML widget to their site. Once completed, they contact the Ring Admin to add their webpage to the list of Member Sites.

## What is Oring?

  Oring is an easy to use open source template that allows anyone to create their own webring.

  1. upload the files to a static website host. I recommend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
  2. Change the values within `webring.json` and `sites.json` to fit your webring

## HTML Widget

   Member sites will insert this code into the HTML body of a webpage.

  ```html
<!-- Replace "RINGADMIN.COM" with the URL of the Ring Master's website -->
    <div>
      <a href="https://RINGADMIN.COM/Oring/webring.html.html?action=prev"> < </a>
      <a href="https://RINGADMIN.COM/Oring/webring.html.html?action=list"> ... </a>
      <a href="https://RINGADMIN.COM/Oring/webring.html.html?action=home"> MYWEBRING </a>
      <a href="https://RINGADMIN.COM/Oring/webring.html.html?action=rand"> ? </a>
      <a href="https://RINGADMIN.COM/Oring/webring.html.html?action=next"> > </a>
    </div>
  ```

  When a visitor on a member site clicks one of these links, they will be directed to a webpage that the ring admin (you) control. The `webring.html` page will run the `webring.js` script.

  The script will look at a list of member websites and find the index of the member site that the visitor was on. The script will then find the previous site in the list, the next site in the list, and a random site in the list. Once the calculations are done, it will read the the link fragment after `?action=` to determine how and where to redirect the visitor.

  }

  let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * (data.webringSites.length));
  let nextIndex = (thisIndex+1 >= data.webringSites.length) ? 0 : thisIndex+1;
  // use the indices calculated above to find the corresponding site URL in the member list
  let previousSiteURL = data.webringSites[previousIndex].siteURL;

  let value = params.action;

  // If the site that the user just came from is not part of the webring, this sets the Previous and Next button to Random.
  if (thisIndex == null) {
    previousIndex = randomIndex;
    nextIndex = randomIndex;
  }

  // Previous, List, Home, Next, Random, or other actions
  if (value == 'prev') {
      window.location.href = previousSiteURL;

      window.location.href = nextSiteURL;

      window.location.href = randomSiteURL; //In-case of value == null

};
```

## `webring.json`

```json
{
    "webringInfo": [
      {"webringName": "Example Ring", "webringHome": "https://example.com/home", "webringMemberList": "https://example.com/home#list"}
    ]
  }
```

## `sites.json`

```json

{
  "webringInfo": [
    {"webringName": "Example Ring", "webringHome": "https://example.com/home", "webringMemberList": "https://example.com/home#list"}
  ],
  "webringSites": [
    { "siteOwner": "Red", "siteName": "Radium's rotation", "siteURL": "https://example.com/1", "siteTags": "Red, roeus", "siteShortDescription": "111", "siteLongDescription": "1111111"},
    { "siteOwner": "Blue", "siteName": "Bird's bounties", "siteURL": "https://example.com/2", "siteTags": "Blue, bacon", "siteShortDescription": "222", "siteLongDescription": "2222222"},
    { "siteOwner": "Green", "siteName": "Greg's grains", "siteURL": "https://example.com/3", "siteTags": "Green, Grass", "siteShortDescription": "333", "siteLongDescription": "3333333"}

  ]
}
```

The JSON is fairly self-explanatory. Edit the values to suit your webring. **Note, after every Member Site entry, there MUST be a comma EXCEPT for the last Member Site entry in-which there MUST NOT have a comma.** *is that convoluted? Yes. Thank JSON for that.*

## Member list

You can generate a list of the webring members by inserting this HTML fragment: `<div id="member-list"><script async src="member-list.js"></script></div>`  into a webpage. You can modify the`member-list.js` script to display any of the data contained within the `webring.json` and `sites.json` files.

Self notes:

* //TODO Nov 4 2022 - Create a diagram explaining the relationship between Ring Master, Member Site, and Visitor.
* //TODO Nov 4 2022 - Add Iframe browsing capability on a Ring Master's webpage to allow for an alternative way for visitors to interact with member sites.
